# Spree Essentials [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/citrus/spree_essential_blog.png)](http://travis-ci.org/citrus/spree_essential_blog)


A complete blogging solution for [Spree Commerce](http://spreecommerce.com) with archives, categories, tags, disqus comments and related products. 

This extension relies on [spree_essentials](https://github.com/citrus/spree_essentials) for it's editor, uploads admin and tab in the admin.


Installation
------------

If you don't already have an existing Spree site, [click here](https://gist.github.com/946719) then come back later... You can also read the Spree docs [here](http://spreecommerce.com/documentation/getting_started.html)...

Otherwise, follow these steps to get up and running with spree_essential_blog:

First, add spree_essential_blog to your Gemfile... it hasn't been released to Rubygems yet so we'll grab it from git.

    gem 'spree_essential_blog', '~> 0.1.0'

Run the generators to create the migration files.

    rails g spree_essentials:install
    rails g spree_essentials:blog

Now migrate your database...

    rake db:migrate
    
Boot your server and checkout the admin!

    rails s
    
    
### Sample Posts

If you'd like some sample posts, just use the rake command from your project:
    
    rake db:sample:blog



Testing
-------

Clone this repo to where you develop, bundle up, then run `dummier` to get the show started:

    git clone git://github.com/citrus/spree_essential_blog.git
    cd spree_essential_blog
    bundle install
    bundle exec dummier

This will generate a fresh rails app in test/dummy, install spree & spree_essential_blog, then migrate the test database. Sweet.

Now run the tests with:

    rake
    
    

Demo
----

You can easily use the `test/dummy` app as a demo of spree_essential_blog. Just `cd` to where you develop and run:
    
    git clone git://github.com/citrus/spree_essential_blog.git
    cd spree_essential_blog
    mkdir lib/dummy_hooks
    mv test/dummy_hooks/after_migrate.rb.sample lib/dummy_hooks/after_migrate.rb
    bundle install
    bundle exec dummier
    cd test/dummy
    bundle exec rake db:migrate
    bundle exec rake db:sample:blog
    bundle exec rails s

Setup is complete. Open `localhost:3000/blog` in your browser to see your posts.
